This repository contains idiomatic C++ client libraries for the following
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) services.

* [Google Cloud BigQuery](google/cloud/bigquery/README.md) (experimental)
* [Google Cloud Bigtable](google/cloud/bigtable/README.md) [[quickstart]](google/cloud/bigtable/quickstart/README.md)
* [Google Cloud Spanner](google/cloud/spanner/README.md) [[quickstart]](google/cloud/spanner/quickstart/README.md)
* [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](google/cloud/pubsub/README.md) [[quickstart]](google/cloud/pubsub/quickstart/README.md)
* [Google Cloud Storage](google/cloud/storage/README.md) [[quickstart]](google/cloud/storage/quickstart/README.md)

See each library's `README.md` file for more information about:

* Where to find the documentation for the library and the service.
* How to get started using the library.
* How to incorporate the library into your build system.
* The library's support status if not Generally Available (GA); unless noted in
  a library's `README.md`, these libraries are all GA and supported by Google.

## Install

On most platforms, with all dependencies installed, the following commands will
compile and install all the libraries:

```sh
cmake -H. -Bcmake-out
cmake --build cmake-out
sudo cmake --build cmake-out --target install
```

You can find detailed instructions on how to install and/or compile all the
dependencies for several platforms in the [packaging guide](doc/packaging.md).

For application developers who prefer to build from source, the quickstart
guides for each library (see above) include instructions on how to incorporate
the library into their CMake-based or Bazel-based builds.

## Quickstart

Each library (linked above) contains a directory named `quickstart/` that's
intended to help you get up and running in a matter of minutes. This
`quickstart/` directory contains a minimal "Hello World" program demonstrating
how to use the library, along with minimal build files for common build
systems, such as CMake and Bazel.

* [Google Cloud Bigtable Quickstart](google/cloud/bigtable/quickstart/README.md)
* [Google Cloud Spanner Quickstart](google/cloud/spanner/quickstart/README.md)
* [Google Cloud Pub/Sub Quickstart](google/cloud/pubsub/quickstart/README.md)
* [Google Cloud Storage Quickstart](google/cloud/storage/quickstart/README.md)

As an example, the following code snippet, taken from [Google Cloud
Storage](google/cloud/storage/README.md), should give you a taste of what it's
like to use one of these C++ libraries.

```cc
#include "google/cloud/storage/client.h"
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "Missing bucket name.\n";
    std::cerr << "Usage: quickstart <bucket-name>\n";
    return 1;
  }
  std::string const bucket_name = argv[1];

  // Create aliases to make the code easier to read.
  namespace gcs = google::cloud::storage;

  // Create a client to communicate with Google Cloud Storage. This client
  // uses the default configuration for authentication and project id.
  google::cloud::StatusOr<gcs::Client> client =
      gcs::Client::CreateDefaultClient();
  if (!client) {
    std::cerr << "Failed to create Storage Client, status=" << client.status()
              << "\n";
    return 1;
  }

  auto writer = client->WriteObject(bucket_name, "quickstart.txt");
  writer << "Hello World!";
  writer.Close();
  if (writer.metadata()) {
    std::cout << "Successfully created object: " << *writer.metadata() << "\n";
  } else {
    std::cerr << "Error creating object: " << writer.metadata().status()
              << "\n";
    return 1;
  }

  auto reader = client->ReadObject(bucket_name, "quickstart.txt");
  if (!reader) {
    std::cerr << "Error reading object: " << reader.status() << "\n";
    return 1;
  }

  std::string contents{std::istreambuf_iterator<char>{reader}, {}};
  std::cout << contents << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```

### API Breaking Changes

In general, we avoid making backwards incompatible changes to our C++ APIs (see
below for the definition of "API"). Sometimes such changes yield benefits to
our customers, in the form of better performance, easier-to-understand APIs,
and/or more consistent APIs across services. When these benefits warrant it, we
will announce these changes prominently in our `CHANGELOG.md` file and in the
affected release's notes. Nevertheless, though we take commercially reasonable
efforts to prevent this, it is possible that backwards incompatible changes go
undetected and, therefore, undocumented. We apologize if this is the case and
welcome feedback or bug reports to rectify the problem.

By "API" we mean the C++ API exposed by public header files in this repo. We
are not talking about the gRPC or REST APIs exposed by Google Cloud servers. We
are also talking only about A**P**I stability -- the ABI is subject to change
without notice. You should not assume that binary artifacts (e.g. static
libraries, shared objects, dynamically loaded libraries, object files) created
with one version of the library are usable with newer/older versions of the
library. The ABI may, and does, change on "minor revisions", and even patch
releases.

We request that our customers adhere to the following guidelines to avoid
accidentally depending on parts of the library we do not consider to be part of
the public API and therefore may change (including removal) without notice:

* You should only include headers matching the `google/cloud/${library}/*.h`,
  `google/cloud/${library}/mock/*.h` or `google/cloud/*.h` patterns.
* You should **NOT** directly include headers in any subdirectories, such as
  `google/cloud/${library}/internal`.
* The files *included from* our public headers are **not part of our public
  API**. Depending on indirect includes may break your build in the future, as
  we may change a header "foo.h" to stop including "bar.h" if "foo.h" no longer
  needs the symbols in "bar.h". To avoid having your code broken, you should
  directly include the public headers that define all the symbols you use (this
  is sometimes known as
  [include-what-you-use](https://include-what-you-use.org/)).
* Any file or symbol that lives within a directory or namespace containing
  "internal", "impl", "test", "detail", "benchmark", "sample", or "example", is
  explicitly **not part of our public API**.
* Any file or symbol with "Impl" or "impl" in its name is **not part of our
  public API**.

Previous versions of the library will remain available on the [GitHub Releases
page](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp/releases).

Note that this document has no bearing on the Google Cloud Platform deprecation
policy described at https://cloud.google.com/terms.
