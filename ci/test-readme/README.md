# Verification Scripts for the Build Instructions

The Dockerfiles in this directory serve as verification scripts for the
installation instructions in the top-level [README](../../README.md) file.

The CI scripts and Dockerfiles are more complex than what most users care about,
they install development tools, such as code formatters, drivers for the
integration tests, and programs to verify the install targets.
