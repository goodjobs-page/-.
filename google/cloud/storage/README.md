# Google Cloud Storage

Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at
any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving
website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or
distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

This directory contains the implementation of the Google Cloud Storage C++

## Status

This library support Google Cloud Storage at the
[GA](../../../README.md#versioning) quality level. Please note that, as is
often the case with C++ libraries, we do **not** follow semantic versioning in
the Cloud C++ client libraries. We make every effort to document
backwards-incompatible API changes in the [release notes](#release-notes) below.

## Documentation

* The [client library reference][doxygen-link] contains full documentation
  for the Cloud Storage C++ client library, and includes code samples for all
  APIs.
* A [quick start][quickstart-link] is part of the client library reference.
* Please consult the [Cloud Storage website][gcs-docs-link] for general
  documentation on Cloud Storage features, APIs, other client libraries, etc.
