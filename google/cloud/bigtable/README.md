## Status

This library support Cloud Bigtable at the
[GA](../../../README.md#versioning) quality level. Please note that, as is
often the case with C++ libraries, we do **not** follow semantic versioning in
the Cloud C++ client libraries. We make every effort to document
backwards-incompatible API changes in the [release notes](#release-notes) below.

## Documentation

* The [client library reference][doxygen-link] contains full documentation
  for the Cloud Storage C++ client library, and includes code samples for all
  APIs.
* A [quick start][quickstart-link] is part of the client library reference.
* Please consult the [Cloud Bigtable website][cbt-docs-link] for general
  documentation on Cloud Bigtable features, APIs, other client libraries, etc.
