# :construction: Google Cloud Pub/Sub C++ Client Library

<!-- This file is automatically generated by ci/generate-markdown/generate-pubsub-readme.sh -->

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for interacting with
[Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/), an asynchronous
messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services
that process events.

Please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

> :warning: This library is under development and subject to breaking
> changes without notice.

## Supported Platforms

* Windows, macOS, Linux
* C++11 (and higher) compilers (we test with GCC \>= 5.4, Clang >= 3.8, and MSVC \>= 2019)
* Environments with or without exceptions
* Bazel and CMake builds

## Documentation

* Official documentation about the [Cloud Pub/Sub][cloud-spanner-docs] service
* [Reference doxygen documentation][doxygen-link] for each release of this client library
* Detailed header comments in our [public `.h`][source-link] files

## Quickstart

The [quickstart/](quickstart/) directory contains a minimal environment to help
you quickly get started using this client library. The following is the "Hello
World" program you'll be running, which should give you a taste of this
library.

```cc
#include "google/cloud/pubsub/publisher.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) try {
  if (argc != 3) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <project-id> <topic-id>\n";
    return 1;
  }

  std::string const project_id = argv[1];
  std::string const topic_id = argv[2];

  // Create a namespace alias to make the code easier to read.
  namespace pubsub = google::cloud::pubsub;
  auto publisher = pubsub::Publisher(
      pubsub::MakePublisherConnection(pubsub::Topic(project_id, topic_id), {}));
  auto id =
      publisher
          .Publish(pubsub::MessageBuilder{}.SetData("Hello World!").Build())
          .get();
  if (!id) throw std::runtime_error(id.status().message());
  std::cout << "Hello World published with id=" << *id << "\n";

  return 0;
} catch (std::exception const& ex) {
  std::cerr << "Standard exception raised: " << ex.what() << "\n";
  return 1;
}
```
